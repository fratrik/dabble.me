      %h4 How do I add a photo to my entry?

      %p When you reply to your Dabble Me email, just attach a photo to the email and it'll get saved with your entry. You can also add a photo on the website when you edit an entry. You can add 1 photo per entry, and we support jpeg, gif, and png photos.
      
      %h4 How do I edit or delete an entry?

      %p
        When visiting the
        =link_to("entries page", past_entries_path) + ","
        you'll see an icon that looks like
        &nbsp;
        %i.fa.fa-pencil-square-o
        &nbsp;
        in the top right. Clicking that icon takes you to the edit page. There's a delete button on the right side of the edit page that looks like
        &nbsp;
        %i.fa.fa-trash
        &nbsp;
        in case you'd like to delete your entry.
      
      %h4 Can I import from OhLife?

      %p          
        Yes! Simply visit the
        =link_to("Importer", import_path) + "."


      %h4 How do I save a copy of my entries?

      %p          
        You can download a copy of your entries at any time at the bottom of the
        =link_to("settings page", edit_user_registration_path + '#export') + "."
      
      %h4 I'm new and didn't get my scheduled email. How come?

      %p
        Things work differently on your first day. Instead of sending the email at your scheduled time, we send your first email right when you sign up. After your first day though, you'll always get your email according to
        =link_to("your settings", edit_user_registration_path) + "."
      
      %h4 Is there a mobile app?

      %p The site is built using a responsive design, so it will look great and function with ease simply visiting it in any mobile browser. Also, the primary action in Dabble Me is writing an entry, which can be done with a phone's email client.
      
      %h4 Are my entries private?

      %p
        We're trying to keep Dabble Me as similar to a real journal as possible, so there's no way to share your entries (no way to email them, no way to post them to Twitter, no way to post them to Facebook, etc.) and they aren't searchable by search engines. Here's a link to our 
        =link_to("privacy policy", privacy_path) + "."
      
      %h4 Can I write entries on the website?

      %p You can write entries on the website for any date. Simply click "New Entry" at the top.
      
      %h4 Can I reply to an email more than once?

      %p Yes - each reply just gets added to that day's entry.

      %h4 What are "Inspirations"

      %p
        Ignore them if you want; they're just little quotes or questions that might inspire you to write. Entries will be tagged with a
        &nbsp;
        %i.fa.fa-lightbulb-o
        &nbsp;
        in the top left of the entry which you can hover over to show the inpsiration that inspired the writing for that specific entry.


      %h4 Who created this?

      %p
        Hi, I'm
        =link_to("Paul Arterburn", "https://twitter.com/parterburn") + "."
        I'm the cofounder of a company called
        =link_to "Brandfolder","https://brandfolder.com"
        which is a brand management platform that gives you the power to organize, manage and share brand assets from a single location. Some of the biggest brands in the world trust me with their brand assets, so you can trust me with your journal entries :)
      
      %h4 Is this really free?

      %p
        The basic service is. If you want premium features like changing email frequency, adding/editing features from the web, adding photos, rich text entry, calendar view, and search you'll need to
        =link_to "subcribe", subscribe_path
        to Dabble Me PRO.

        I've also open-sourced the code on GitHub, so if you're a Ruby on Rails developer and want to contribute head over to
        = link_to "http://github.com/parterburn/dabble.me", "http://github.com/parterburn/dabble.me", title: "View code on GitHub"

      %h4 If my question wasn't answered here, how can I contact you?
      %p
        Through email:
        =mail_to("hello@#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}", "hello@#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}", encode: "hex")
