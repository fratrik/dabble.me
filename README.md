# Dabble Me
### The open-source replacement for OhLife

Dabble Me helps people remember what's happened in their life. Use it as a light-weight journal on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis...it's up to you! Dabble Me will email you on a time & days you choose - you simply reply to the email to post entries. The app is live at [https://dabble.me](https://dabble.me).

This app utilizes the following 3rd party services:

* [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com) manages DNS + free SSL support (free for basic service)
* [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) for Sending & Receiving Email (free for 200 emails per day)
* [Filepicker](http://filepicker.io) for Photo Uploads & Storage (free for 500 uploads per month)
* [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) for sending updates to all users (free for 2000 subscribers)
* [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) for traffic stats (free for standard analytics)

I recommend forking and setting up a server at [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). You can generate a free SSL certificate at [StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com/).

You will need to setup SendGrid to receive incoming emails and point them to your app to parse. Visit this [Settings Page](https://sendgrid.com/developer/reply); add your hostname of ```post.yourdomain.com``` and point the URL to ```https://yourdomain.com/email_processor```. I have spam check turned off, since that hasn't been an issue yet. Make sure you setup an MX record for the ```post.yourdomain.com``` subdomain that points to ```mx.sendgrid.net```.

In order to turn on scheduled emails in Heroku, you'll need to add an hourly job using the Heroku Scheduler.
```
rake entry:send_hourly_entries
```

Your local environment variables at ```config/local_env.yml``` will need to be something like this:

```
MAIN_DOMAIN: yourdomain.com
SECRET_KEY_BASE: 1234..1234
DEVISE_SECRET_KEY: 1234..1234
SMTP_DOMAIN: post.yourdomain.com
SENDGRID_USERNAME: your_sendgrid_username
SENDGRID_PASSWORD: your_sendgrid_password
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY: f....3333-ek3
MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID: 9982...112
FILEPICKER_API_KEY: A....z
FILEPICKER_CDN_HOST: https://123abc.cloudfront.net
ADMIN_EMAILS: user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com
DOWNLOADER_ID: 1234..1234
DOWNLOADER_SECRET: 1234..1234
DOWNLOADER_URL: us.downloader.io
```

Your environment variables on Heroku will need to be something like this:

```
MAIN_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
SMTP_DOMAIN=post.yourdomain.me
RAILS_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY_BASE=1234..1234
DEVISE_SECRET_KEY=1234..1234
SENDGRID_USERNAME=username
SENDGRID_PASSWORD=password
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-12345-67
FILEPICKER_API_KEY=A....z
FILEPICKER_CDN_HOST=https://123abc.cloudfront.net
ADMIN_EMAILS=user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com

MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=f....3333-ek3
MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID=9982...112
```

###Things you may want to rip out

Filepicker has an option to use Cloudfront to serve up the photos you upload. This will make loading your images a bit faster, so I recommend it if you already have AWS setup. However, you can skip this if you don't want to mess with all that by simply setting ```FILEPICKER_CDN_HOST=https://www.filepicker.io```.

If you want to bypass using Mailchimp to collect email addresses, simply don't put a value in for MAILCHIMP_API_KEY. I use Mailchimp to email out new features to the users at Dabble.me, so if you're the only one using your app it doesn't make sense to have Mailchimp.


###Administration Portal

The Admin emails are accounts that have access to the Admin Dropdown in the navbar (lock icon) that give you details into the number of entries and users in the system.

###Inspirations and OhLife Importer

If you want random bits of inspiration, you can load up different quotes in the Inspiration table to be shown above the New Posts page and at the bottom of emails. If you plan on using OhLife, the system will tag imported posts with ```inspiration_id``` of 1 - so create the first Inspiration with a category name of "OhLife".

```
Inspiration.create(category: 'OhLife', body: 'Imported from OhLife')
```
